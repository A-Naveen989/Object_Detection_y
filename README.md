# 🧠 Object Detection with YOLOv5

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art deep learning model. The goal is to identify and localize multiple objects in images and videos efficiently and accurately.

## 📌 Project Overview

Object detection is a fundamental computer vision task that involves identifying and localizing objects within images or videos. YOLOv5, developed by Ultralytics, provides a fast and accurate one-stage detection approach that is suitable for real-time applications. This project uses YOLOv5 to train and test a model on either a custom or public dataset and deploy it for live or recorded object detection tasks.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `data/` : Dataset directory (images and labels in YOLO format)
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks for training and testing
- `scripts/` : Python scripts for training, detection, and exporting models
- `yolov5/` : YOLOv5 cloned directory from Ultralytics

## 📦 Dataset

You can use a custom dataset annotated with LabelImg or Roboflow, or a public dataset such as COCO or Pascal VOC. The dataset should be organized in YOLO format:

data/
├── images/
│ ├── train/
│ └── val/
└── labels/
├── train/
└── val/
